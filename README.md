# Game-of-Thrones-Battles-Analysis ⚔️  
## About Project :
#### << This project is made using R language as a part of NASSCOM Future Skills  Associative Data Analyst Course and is a learning model to test our learning on ggplot2 !>> <br><br>
✌ Demonstrate Exploratory Data Analysis using plots and graphs using the information extracted from text. <br>
✌ Have a look at the [**CSV File**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nupur1492/RProjects/master/GameOfThrones/battles.csv)!<br>
✌ Analysis will be done on :-<br>
✔Which region had most battles?<br>
✔Which year had most battles? Who was the attcker; who won?<br>
✔Most battles initiated by king? what was the outcome?<br>
✔Most battles defended; what was the outcome?<br>
✔Which type of battle was most fought at what location?<br>
✔Attacker size vs defender size; outcome of battle<br>
✔Which commander was most successful?<br>

## About ggplot2:
ggplot2 is an open-source data visualization package for the statistical programming language R. Created by Hadley Wickham in 2005, ggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson's Grammar of Graphics—a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers.
